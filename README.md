# eggifier

 A stupid project idea I decided to come up with that replaces every single noun with "egg".

## Running locally

 In order to run it locally, run these following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxfandudeguy/eggifier.git
bun install
bun dev -- --open
```
## How to use

In order to use this, Type any sentence with a noun (More nouns increases intensity) and click the "`Eggify!`" button.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
