[![Eggifier project on codesandbox](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e3a2d1d-4ded-4942-b1d8-8fb45455bbab)](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/linuxfandudeguy/eggifier/master?import=true)

 A stupid project idea I decided to come up with that replaces every single noun with "egg".

Also, technically my first AI project that actually ran smoothly as this uses `Compromise.js` for `NLP` (`Natural language Processing`).

The reason why this is my first AI project that "ran successfully" is because every single time I try to make an AI project, it always never works.
